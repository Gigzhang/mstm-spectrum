## About
Python wrapper for multiple sphere T-matrix (MSTM) code to calculate surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrum

Based and inspired by MSMT GUI code <https://git.stim.ee.uh.edu/optics/mstm-gui.git> by David Mayerich.

Multi-Sphere T-Matrix code is proposed by Dr. Daniel Mackowski and Dr. Michael Mishchenko in:
Mackowski and Mishchenko, "A multiple sphere T-matrix Fortran code for use on parallel computer clusters," Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, 112: 2182-2192, 2011.

Please cite the above reference if using MSTM code.
